# QKD_FYP_22
This is a save sapce for my FYP propgress in Quantum Key Distribution.
  The Aim of this FYP is to
    -Simulate BB84 and introduce Noise
    -Do error correction on simuilated protocol to achieve a low error rate
    -See any correlatioin between RNG's to get an accurate values
    -See the relationship of bit lenght and error rates
