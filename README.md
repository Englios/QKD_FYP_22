# QKD_FYP_22
This is a save sapce for my FYP progress in **Quantum Key Distribution.**


## The Aim of this FYP
    -Simulate **BB84** and introduce Noise
    -Do **error correction** on simuilated protocol to achieve a low error rate
    -See any correlatioin between RNG's to get an accurate values
    -See the relationship of **bit lenght and error rates**
