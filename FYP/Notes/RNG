        Follow Mersennes Twister as a basis to generate the random numbers
            Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two. 
            That is, it is a prime number of the form Mn = 2^n âˆ’ 1 for some integer n.
                The Mersenne Twister algorithm generates pseudo-random numbers based on a seed value, 
                which is used to initialize the internal state of the algorithm. 
                The state of the algorithm is updated with each call to the random number generator function, 
                and the output value is derived from the state using a mathematical formula.
