BB84 Protocol

    Preparation of Qubit
        Bits are encoded into qubits by polarzation and bases
        -Rectilinear Basis (X)
            -Vertical
            -Horizontal
                Bit
                    |0> = [1,0]
                    |1> = [0,1]
        -Diagonal Basis (Z)
            -Diagonal
            -Anti-Diagonal
                Bits
                    |+> = [1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)]
                    |-> = [1/sqrt(2),-1/sqrt(2)]

    Send Qubits through Quantum Channel to Bob
        Set Noise Level(p)
            Choose random noise below the noise level
                The matrix multiply the values with the sent Qubits
                Then Return Noisy Qubits for transmission to Bob

    Bob Decodes Qubit
        Choosing random bases,Bob decodes qubits for each random bit

    Both Parties share bases used
        Both parties share the bases they use,for the unmatching bases,bits are discarded
