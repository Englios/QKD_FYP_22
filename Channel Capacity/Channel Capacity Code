Find Capacity of Channel Code
    Use The simplest form of a channel
    Find Bit lenght or change bit lenght of a message
    Change some parameters
    Then plot between Channel Capacity and Bit lenght
    Move on to Bit Error

    Add some noise to channel and see what happens
        Noise in form of random number generator which changes the probability of the message
        See the probability of bit flip
    
For a Noiseless Channel (Nyst Theorem)
    C= 2BLog2^n
        C= Channel Capacity
        B= bandwidht
